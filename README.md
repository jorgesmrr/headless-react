# headless-react

A collection of headless React components packaged using the [Bit](https://bit.dev) platform.

I use them only to share some code between my side-projects/experiments, so feel free to try them but do not use in serious projects.

## Usage

Each component can be installed separatedely, via NPM or Yarn.

They are available at the following page: https://bit.dev/jorgemoreira/headless-react.

To have the correct behavior and customization, import the following package right before your global styles: https://bit.dev/jorgemoreira/headless/styles
