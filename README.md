# headless-react

A collection of unstyled React components packaged using the Bit platform.

I use them to share some code between my side projects. Feel free to use, but not in production.

You can install each component individually, using NPM or Yarn. They are available at the following page: https://bit.dev/jorgemoreira/headless-react.
